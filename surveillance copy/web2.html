                    “I was seventeen. Only child, not a lot of friends. But I had a plan. I was going to become
                    an actress, get a role on
                    All My Children, meet my husband on set– and when that was all over, I’d host a talk show.
                    Kelly Ripa did it; I could do
                    it too.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Back then it seemed like every woman on television had gotten their start as beauty
                    queen. So my senior year I
                    decided to enter my school’s Homecoming Queen competition. It was organized like a Ms.
                    America pageant. But this was a
                    rough high school, only one other girl signed up, so I had a good shot. My whole family got
                    behind me. My mom was a
                    seamstress. We noticed that in most pageants we watched, the winner wore a white dress. So
                    she sewed me a white dress
                    that I picked out of Seventeen Magazine.
                </p>

                <p>
                    First came the interview portion, and that’s when
                    the trouble started. The
                    judges asked me about the Anita Hill testimony; I wasn’t ready for that. I was ready for
                    world peace. They were supposed
                    to ask me about my goals, so I could say world peace. But that didn’t happen. The talent
                    portion was later that night at
                    the homecoming dance. The whole school was there. I chose a Sheena Easton song; poor choice.
                    Not the right crowd for
                    that. The other girl chose ‘I Feel Good’ by Stephanie Mills, and she had the whole crowd
                    singing along. That’s when I
                    knew it was over. But then, a miracle. The guidance counselor quieted everyone down, and
                    announced the winner: it was
                    me. Me! It was my Kelly Kapowski moment. Everyone was cheering, the other girl congratulated
                    me. But it only lasted five
                    seconds, because the guidance counselor said: ‘Wait a second, I’m sorry. Joanna is the
                    runner-up.’ It was the worst
                    moment of my life. In fact, the only thing that got me through COVID was knowing that it
                    could not possibly, possibly be
                    worse than that moment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And here’s a twist for you. Remember that guidance counselor?
                    Several years later I ended up
                    acting alongside his son in a play at Queens College. In one scene I pulled a gun on him,
                    and the director was like: ‘We
                    need more anger. Think about something that makes you angry.’ I was like: ‘Well, that’s
                    easy. His father ruined my
                    senior year. And quite possibly, my entire life.”
